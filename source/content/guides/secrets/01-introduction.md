# Pantheon Secrets

## Introduction

Pantheon Secrets is key to maintaining industry best practices for secure builds and application implementation. This feature provides a convenient mechanism for you to manage your secrets and API keys directly on the Pantheon platform.
This guide covers features and use cases of the Pantheon Secrets feature; it could also be referred as Secrets Manager because that is the Terminus plugin name.
Features

* Secure: secrets are encrypted at rest.
* Easy to use: create and update secrets via Terminus.
* Governability: secrets could be set at organization level and shared to all the sites owned by that organization.
* Overridable: secrets could be overridden at environment level when needed.
  Support

Community submitted bugs and feature requests can be found in the plugin, SDK or Drupal module issue queues. You can create an issue in the corresponding component if you don't see your bug or feedback listed.

[Contact Support](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/#support/support/all) if you have questions or need help with Terminus.

Use Case: Accessing secrets from your codebase
Introduction
Include this note: "Note: Only get has been implemented so far. You should handle your secrets through terminus using Terminus Secrets Manager." Do not present this as something we "may" do in the future!

Note: this also applies to quicksilver scripts
Mechanism 1: get_pantheon_secrets

Pantheon Secrets and local development environments
Introduction
Your local dev env won't ever be able to talk directly to secrets service so you need workarounds!! (THIS IS NOT REAL DOCS TEXT)


Document this: https://github.com/pantheon-systems/customer-secrets-php-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#local-environment-usage


Troubleshooting
Integrated Composer Build fails on private packages

What about open source projects? I (Kevin) still think it's better to go through support but unsure‚Ä¶


[a]Page ready for review
[b]Not sure of better wording for this but agree with this as a page
[c]Yeah, happy to rename it if anyone has suggestions
[d]just a note that we should be careful to qualify what works here.  we've had people ask for methods that aren't supported... iirc one was "a single secret for all multidevs, but different from dev"

[e]since the actual plugin installation is a single command, i'd list the first step as being on the latest version of terminus and link to terminus install doc there.. then i'd put the literal `terminus plugin:install` command in a code box for quick copy/paste.  can still link to plugins docu if desired.
[f]Also need a section for env overrides (for both site secrets and org secrets)
[g]I added env overrides as a concept in the previous page and will of course mention them in both site and org secrets.


Env overrides are not a command by themselves but options in the commands
[h]My intuition is that this should come after the "Accessing secrets from your codebase".  I think the latter will probably be the more common use case, and isn't CMS-specific.


But I don't feel strongly about it
[i]POOP
[j]j/k.  This is the composer package, right? `get_pantheon_secrets` isn't the composer package?  If that's right, then I'd say "composer package" or "composer library"?
